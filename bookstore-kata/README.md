## Description

### Target of Evaluation

A publisher wants to unify its authoring Content Management System (CMS) and customer store experience, trying to get books published to customers as quickly as possible.
Users: dozens of publisher employees, hundreds of authors, thousands/millions of customers

* Requirements:
  * authors publish chapters
  * reviewers see the chapters, make review comments, and notify authors on review
  * authors can reject proposed review changes
  * supports both copy and technical editing
  * customers can buy books (either e- form or dead trees form) online, including those available in 'beta'
  * publisher can push authors' chapters to those customers who bought the 'beta'
* Additional Context:
  * The business is driven to this decision because competitors have a similar offering.
  * Competition for authors is tight.
  * This is part of a long-term strategy to modernize the publishing aspects of the business.
  * Information needed to publish a book (distribution, royalties, marketing) comes from several disparate systems, ranging from emailed Excel spreadsheets to mainframe integration with the printing facility.
