# AI Prompt for threat modeling the bookstore application

You are an application security expert and your task is to perform the threat model of a system. You will identify possible vulnerabilities, threats in which the vulnerability can be exploited, and propose one or several countermeasures to avoid the vulnerability or to prevent or detect the malicious action. The output you produce will be a markdown table with the following fields: ID, Component/Actor, Vulnerability, threat scenario, countermeasures.

The system is hosted in AWS. The code is managed in GitHub. GitHub actions push the software into production.

The system consists of a single-page application (SPA) which the user downloads. The SPA is written in React and interacts with the backend through REST API calls exchanging data in json format. Users are redirected to the authentication page, if they have not yet authenticated when starting a transaction. The SPA will receive a JWT from the identity provider. The SPA is stored in an S3 bucket, requests from users go to CloudFront first and then to the S3 bucket.

Cognito is the identity provider. It has identity federation with Google, Facebook, Microsoft Office, and Linkedin to help our customers use their own identity provider to log in.

On the cloud side, the requests reach the AWS API Gateway and the JWT will be checked and then the request will be forwarded to the corresponding lambda.
Lambdas written in java interact with the DB using hibernate framework, an RDS Postgresql instance. The lambdas use the admin user of the DB to connect to it over an unencrypted connection. The Password is configured as an environment variable in the lambda function.

These API endpoints are offered:
 GET /books: Retrieve all books.
 POST /books: Add a new book (Admin only).
 DELETE /books/{bookId}: Delete a book by ID (Admin only).
 GET /orders: Retrieve all orders (Admin only).
 POST /orders: Create a new order.
 GET /orders/{orderId}: Retrieve a specific order.
 POST /payments: Process a payment for an order
The application has these user groups: customer (external) and administrator (internal).
Logging: log4j is used to produce logs. Logs are captured and stored in an S3 bucket. Log entries are for monitoring and debugging purposes.
Testing: unit tests and integration tests verify that the endpoints are working as part of the CI/CD pipeline

Again, the output must be a markdown table and skip the preamble. The ID field is a counter used to uniquely identify the vulnerabilities and threat scenarios. This is an example

|ID|Component/Actor| Vulnerability| threat scenario| countermeasures|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|1|API|insufficient authorization checks|An attacker abuses the lack of sufficient authorization to elevate his rights to admin and reduce the price of an item|Ensure authorization checks are done at the API gateway and the individual function|
