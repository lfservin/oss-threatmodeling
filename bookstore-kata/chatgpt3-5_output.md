| ID | Component/Actor | Vulnerability | Threat Scenario | Countermeasures |
|----|-----------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1  | SPA             | Insecure Storage| An attacker gains unauthorized access to the S3 bucket storing the SPA, leading to potential tampering or data theft.| Implement proper S3 bucket policies and access controls. Enable versioning for the S3 bucket to track changes. Use AWS CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI) to restrict access.|
| 2  | Identity Provider (Cognito) | Identity Spoofing | An attacker attempts to impersonate a user by forging authentication tokens or exploiting weaknesses in identity federation with external providers.| Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users. Regularly audit and rotate secret keys. Monitor and log authentication events for suspicious activities.|
| 3  | API Gateway | Insufficient JWT Validation | An attacker provides a forged or expired JWT to the API Gateway, bypassing authentication checks.| Implement robust JWT validation mechanisms at the API Gateway, checking signature, expiration, and issuer. Use short-lived JWTs and enforce secure token transmission.|
| 4  | Lambda Functions | Unencrypted Connection to RDS | An attacker eavesdrops on the unencrypted communication between Lambda functions and the RDS database, potentially intercepting sensitive information.| Enable SSL/TLS for the communication between Lambda functions and RDS. Avoid storing sensitive information like database passwords in environment variables; use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store. Regularly rotate database credentials.|
| 5  | API Endpoints | Inadequate Authorization | An attacker exploits insufficient authorization checks in API endpoints, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive actions such as adding or deleting books.| Implement proper authorization checks at both the API Gateway and individual Lambda functions. Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to restrict permissions. Conduct regular security audits.|
| 6  | Logging (Log4j) | Log Injection | An attacker injects malicious content into logs, potentially causing log forging or injecting harmful scripts.| Sanitize user input in logs and employ proper encoding. Limit access to log files and ensure that log files are not accessible to unauthorized users. Regularly review and analyze logs for anomalies.|
| 7  | CI/CD Pipeline | Insecure CI/CD Configuration | An attacker exploits misconfigurations in the CI/CD pipeline to introduce malicious code into the production environment.| Implement secure CI/CD practices, such as code signing, code analysis, and automated vulnerability scanning. Regularly review and update CI/CD configurations. Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles with the principle of least privilege.|
| 8  | Testing | Inadequate Test Coverage | A vulnerability in the system remains undetected due to insufficient test coverage, leading to potential security gaps.| Enhance unit tests and integration tests to cover a broader range of security scenarios. Implement regular security testing, including penetration testing and code reviews. Maintain a secure coding standard and provide security training for developers.|
| 9  | S3 Bucket (Logs) | Unauthorized Access | An attacker gains unauthorized access to the S3 bucket containing logs, potentially exposing sensitive information.| Implement strict S3 bucket policies, access controls, and encryption for log storage. Enable logging and monitoring for S3 bucket access. Regularly audit and review access logs.|
