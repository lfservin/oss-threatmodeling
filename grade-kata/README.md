## Target of Evaluation

* Objective: A very large and populous state would like a new system to support standardized testing across all public school systems grades 3-12.

* Users: 40,000+ students, 2000 graders, 50 administrators.
* Requirements:
  * Students will only be able to use the application within testing centers around the state, most of these will be in the schools, but not all of them
  * Students should be able to take a test, and the results eventually consolidated to a single location representing all of the test scores across the state (by school, teacher, and student).
  * Tests will be multiple choice, short answer, and essay.
  * The system should have a reporting system to know which students have taken the tests and what score they received.
  * Short answer and essay questions will be manually graded by teachers, who will then add the essay grades to the system.
* Additional Context:
  * A change approval processes involving three different government agencies is required for changes to the way student grades are kept to ensure security.
  * The state does not own its hosting center, but outsources it to a third party.
  * Project must defend its budget each fiscal year.
